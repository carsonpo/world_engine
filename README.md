# Scope

### What this package is
A tool which does one thing and does it well

In scope:
- Optimized implementations for Nvidia, AMD, Apple Silicon, etc
- Consumer and data center hardware
- Abstracting away the DiT and Autoencoder models - user only handles controller inputs, text prompts, and images.
- Loading World Models and LoRA adapters

### What this package isn't
This isn't a full featured client, it's a core library.

Out of scope:
- Rendering video
- Reading controllers / keyboard inputs
- FAL integration, other integrations

Anything out of scope can be added to `examples/`, which isn't importable or part of the `world_model` package.
